Paradox of Choice (Barry Schwartz)
=======

1. Simplicity
    Only 25 keywords
    1. No classes (only structs and functions)
    2. no inheritance (only composition)
    3. no access modifiers (public, private, protected)
    4. no exceptions (only errors)
    5. Pointers are supported but no pointer arithmetic
    6. Value by default
    . Only one looping construct - for loop - that can be used in differnt ways

2. Performance

3. Built for concurrency
    go, chan (data type), <- (channel operator), built-in scheduler


To run the go program
 go run 01-hello-world.go

To create a build
    go build 01-hello-world.go
    go  build -o hw 01-hello-world.go
